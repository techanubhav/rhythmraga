              <p>
              Rhythm Raga traces its roots back to the Devashram School of Music in India, a renowned institution dedicated to preserving and promoting the rich traditions of Indian classical music and dance. For over three decades, Devashram has nurtured hundreds of students in vocals, tabla, and other classical instruments, shaping confident performers and passionate learners.
              </p>
              <p>
              Today, Rhythm Raga offers formal coaching in Bollywood dance, Indian classical and semi-classical vocals, tabla, guitar, keyboard, and more. With a strong focus on personal growth, cultural connection, and stage confidence, our mission is to inspire every learner to embrace their rhythm â€” and carry it forward in every aspect of life.
